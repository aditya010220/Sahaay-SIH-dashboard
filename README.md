</div>

Sahaay is a proactive, privacy-preserving digital mental health framework designed for Indian university students. It leverages multimodal AI and passive sensing from smartphones for the early risk detection of anxiety and depression. The ecosystem features an empathetic AI chatbot, a robust early warning system, and pioneering Indian Sign Language (ISL) support for inclusivity.

✨ Core Features
🧠 Proactive Early Warning System (EWS): Uses multi-model data (passive sensing, affective computing) to identify students at risk of mental health decline before a crisis occurs.

💬 Empathetic AI Chatbot: A 24/7 conversational agent providing confidential psychological first-aid, evidence-based self-help tools (CBT, Mindfulness), and empathetic support.

🔐 Privacy-by-Design: Built from the ground up to comply with India's DPDP Act (2023), using Federated Learning to ensure sensitive user data never leaves their device.

🧏 Indian Sign Language (ISL) Support: A novel accessibility module featuring ISL recognition (input) and synthesis (output via a 3D avatar) to support deaf and hard-of-hearing students.

🤝 Peer Support & Professional Help: Integrates a clinically moderated anonymous peer support network and a secure system to connect with human therapists.

📊 Anonymized Institutional Dashboard: Provides university administrators with aggregated, privacy-preserving insights into campus-wide mental health trends to inform wellness policies.

🎯 The Mission
University students in India face a critical mental health crisis, driven by immense academic pressure and pervasive stigma. This has resulted in a staggering 70-92% treatment gap, leaving millions without support. Our mission is to bridge this gap by creating a proactive, accessible, and confidential first line of defense, shifting the paradigm from reactive crisis management to preventative mental wellness.

🚀 Technological Innovations
Multi-model Early Warning System: Our EWS fuses four data streams—Physiological (wearables), Behavioral (phone sensors), Textual (journal entries), and Vocal/Visual (optional)—into a deep learning model to predict mental health risks with higher accuracy.

Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning (PPML): We implement a Federated Learning framework where the AI model is trained on-device. Only anonymized model updates, not raw data, are sent to the server, maximizing both accuracy and user privacy.

Inclusivity through AI: We utilize a custom CNN-LSTM computer vision model for real-time ISL translation, making Sahaay one of the first mental health platforms to be fully accessible to the ISL-using community.
